NOTE:

I have removed all formal git tags. See PICOS (PG170721A). The repository
presently contains locaspot (which also exists as a separate repo named
ALPHANET). We may remove locaspot or keep it around, but we should not
treat it as Alphanet any longer.

PG170812:

	I have tweaked SEAWOLF/YEP to compile under picomp (i.e., PIP). The
	idea is that there should be no single serious praxis that must be
	compiled in the legacy mode.

PG170818A:

	Read PG170818A in PICOS. I have made YEP picomp-compliant and fixed
	a few minor problems that surfaced after some PICOS system files
	became picomp-compliant.

PG190203A:

	Fixed netting_demo to work with CC1350 devices.

	An old (pending) upgrade of my "septic tank" sensor.
