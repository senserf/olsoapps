NOTE:

I have removed all formal git tags. See PICOS (PG170721A). The repository
presently contains locaspot (which also exists as a separate repo named
ALPHANET). We may remove locaspot or keep it around, but we should not
treat it as Alphanet any longer.

PG170812:

	I have tweaked SEAWOLF/YEP to compile under picomp (i.e., PIP). The
	idea is that there should be no single serious praxis that must be
	compiled in the legacy mode.
