			RSS is supposed to be in dBm with 1/2 dBm resolution.
			So the span is 128 dBm with some initial values of RSS
			deemed non-receivable. The minimum value I spotted in
			the sample file was 54.

			The official formula to transform RSSI into dBm (from
			the manual) is this:

				dbm = (rss - 128) / 2 - 74

			128 is our bias (our driver converts the value into
			a nonnegative (unsigned) 8-bit number. This basically
			boils down to rss / 2 - 138.

			The max RSS = 255 thus translates into -10.5 dBm.
			The max value I see in the samples is 165 => -55.5 dBm,
			which looks fair enough. This is the S/N ratio of
			60.5 dBm (which we should look at as a maximum power
			[virtually perfect] reception).
