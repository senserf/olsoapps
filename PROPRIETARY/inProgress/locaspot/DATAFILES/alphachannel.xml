			RSS is supposed to be in dBm with 1/2 dBm resolution.
			So the span is 128 dBm with some initial values of RSS
			deemed non-receivable. The minimum value I spotted in
			the sample file was 18. There are a few values in low
			20-ties.

			The official formula to transform RSSI into dBM (from
			the manual) is this:

				dbm = (rss - 128) / 2 - 74

			128 is our bias (our driver transforms the value into
			a nonnegative (unsigned) 8-bit number. This basically
			boils down to rss / 2 - 138.

				RSS =  24	=>	-126 dBm
				RSS = 150	=>	 -63 dBm
				RSS = 254	=>	 -11 dBm

			So I am setting RSS = 25 correspond to -103.0 dBm
			yielding 5.0dB above the BN. The BER at that signal
			level should be of order 0.02 yielding about 0.1
			chance of receiving correctly 100 bits.

			The max RSS = 255 thus translates into -103 + 120 =
			17 dBm, which is impossible. But the max value I see in
			the samples is 149 => -41 dBm, which looks fair enough.
			This is the S/N ratio of 67 dBm (which we should look
			at as a maximum [virtually perfect reception].
