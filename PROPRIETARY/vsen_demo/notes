This vsens_demo shows non-uniform collectors handled by the same aggregators (and OSS(I)). PEG, TAG parts morphed from KRK_NED which was derived from eco_demo, see the notes there, for history.

app_col adds even less compliant 'travelling collector' on CHRONOS board. This part came from il_demo, with several modifications. It still includes some il_demo functionality that is not used here. See notes there, especially for CHRONOS functionality. It is maintained here, plus a simple lcd_off after 15s of sleep. Since there is no remote buttons here, 'events' are folded into 'buttons'.

To manage setups with Chronos, comparing with the previous submission, only the Master must be reflashed - plev and rssi are displayed as Chronos sensors. 

econnect and piter (with piter_plug.tcl) are part of this adventure; the works should continue there, too, for the future OSSI module.

It didn't go too well; I hope to continue it, with folding collectors back into one program and setting decent sensor modules. In general, this can be a playground for better modularity we plan for OSSI, storage, et al.
